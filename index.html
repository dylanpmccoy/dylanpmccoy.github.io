    <p>ABOUT ME I’m an award-winning journalist with more than a decade of experience covering education, families, and communities. My reporting has prompted Indiana to return schools to local control, increased scrutiny of graduation rates, and exposed how the state violated federal law by allowing people with emergency permits to teach special education. In a recent NPR story, I revealed how a federal investigation into the mistreatment of a rural student with disabilities stalled after the Trump administration cut staff at the U.S. Education Department.
My work has appeared on NPR’s All Things Considered, Morning Edition, Weekend Edition, and in The Atlantic, earning honors from the Education Writers Association, National Headliner Awards, Public Media Journalists Association, and Regional Edward R. Murrow Awards.</p>
